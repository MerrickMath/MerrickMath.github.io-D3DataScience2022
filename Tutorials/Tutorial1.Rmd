In this class we introduced the tidyverse and ggplot packages. For this tutorial both the music and lego datsets were used. We first looked at how to load the packages into r using the library() function, and then talked about filtering data and making some (gorgeous) plots. Code is shown below. 

```{r}
# Using the Tidyverse and GGplot2
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#### USING THE MUSIC DATASET
music <- read.csv('Datasets/spotify.csv')
lego <- read.csv('Datasets/lego.csv')

#### Filtering data 
music %>% filter(danceability>.5) %>% ggplot(aes(x=danceability)) + 
  geom_histogram()

lego %>% ggplot(aes(x=Price, y=rating)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

music %>% ggplot(aes(y=danceability))+geom_boxplot()

music %>% filter(artists=="['Justin Bieber']" | artists=="['Eminem']") %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=danceability, col=artists))+geom_boxplot()
```
